            <p>You’re disgusting. You’re disgusting.</p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.
            </p>

            <p>Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You
                either have it or you don't. You’re disgusting. You’re disgusting.</p>

            <p>The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family. I think the only card she has
                is the Lorem card.</p>

            <p> Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! Some
                people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either
                have it or you don't. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with
                other websites.</p>
